# Calcium_model_explaining_refractory
This repository contains the code for an astrocyte calcium signaling model that explains refractory period. The folder functions/ contains all necessary functions for the model, which have been divided into several sub-folders based on their categories. Generally, it contains the code for simulating the calcium signal and parameter optimization. The folder Data/ contains the experimental data we used in model fitting (after pre-processing). In Data/, there are subfolders for four mice which participated in the experiment. Within a folder for a mouse, there are subfolders for recordings from diffrent recording locations on its motor cortex. Within the folder for a recording location, there are specific calcium recording data. The MAT files contain the real calcium signal extracted from calcium recording video (attribute name: avg_roi_temp_down), the mouse's run velocity time series (attribute name: velocity), and a table containing the visual stimuli and reward information (attribute name: TT). 

**To run a demo, please download this repository and open the main.m by MATLAB.** In main.m, you can set the mouse's name, recording location, and recording number, according to the contents in Data/ folder, and then do a simulation on the calcium signaling and compare with the experimentally measured calcium signal.
